            <p>I feel so proud and happy since she came into my life, after she came to my life, these two Eid's felt
                like
                the first Eid's for me, Otherwise i would not have understood the real joy of Eids. You have brought me
                from
                darkness to light, as the sun illuminates the moon with its light. Honestly, I am very lucky to have you
                as
                a guide, who has taught me to be a better person every moment. </p>
